# Self-Learning-Based-PoG-Prediction-Master-s-Thesis-
This thesis introduces a novel approach for estimating a driver's point of gaze (PoG) using in-vehicle cameras, reducing reliance on expensive data collection processes. The proposed method leverages self-learning, enabling the algorithm to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data, enhancing efficiency and scalability.
